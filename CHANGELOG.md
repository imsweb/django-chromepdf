# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.7.1](https://github.com/imsweb/django-chromepdf/tree/1.7.1) - 2024-02-20

**Fixed**

- The url path used by Chrome for serving chromedrivers has changed. ChromePDF has been updated to match. A helper function has been added that uses the official JSON endpoint to try and detect such changes in the future.

## [1.7.0](https://github.com/imsweb/django-chromepdf/tree/1.7.0) - 2023-10-23

**Changed**

- License changed from BSD 2-Clause License to BSD 3-Clause License.
- Minor adjustments to experimental no-Selenium feature.

## [1.6.0](https://github.com/imsweb/django-chromepdf/tree/1.6.0) - 2023-07-20

**Fixed**

- Support was added for the new Chromedriver endpoint that is being used for Chrome version 115 and later. See [documentation](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/chrome-for-testing) and [announcement](https://groups.google.com/g/chromedriver-users/c/clpipqvOGjE) for details.

**Added**

- Added experimental method of using ChromePDF to generate PDFs without using Selenium. ChromePDF will fall back to communicating with the chromedriver directly via HTTP requests. You may trigger this in one of three ways:
  - Pass `use_selenium=False` to `generate_pdf()`, or
  - Set `settings.CHROMEPDF['USE_SELENIUM'] = False` in your Django settings, or
  - Pass `--use-selenium=0` if calling via command-line option (`python -m chromepdf`)

## [1.5.0](https://github.com/imsweb/django-chromepdf/tree/1.5.0) - 2023-02-22

**Added**

- Added pyproject.toml file for setup install. Backwards compatibility is still provided via setup.py for Python environments with setuptools<61 installed, in particular Python 3.6, which only supports setuptools<61 and therefore cannot use pyproject.toml. Support for Python 3.6 and Selenium 3 will end with the eventual release of ChromePDF 2.0.

**Changed**

- Chromedrivers downloaded to `chromepdf/chromedrivers/` now contain the full Chrome version string, rather than just the major version. If a Chrome exe is updated to a new minor version but same major version, this will now trigger a separate chromedriver download when it would not have before, to account for the possibility that it requires an updated chromedriver.
- If an exception occurs when trying to determine the Chrome version, the error message will now clearly state whether or not an executable actually exists at the path provided.
- `chromepdf.webdrivers.get_chrome_version()` has a new parameter, `as_tuple=True`. Passing `False` will return the version as a string instead. Returning a tuple by default will continue to work as before, but is now deprecated. It is now called using `as_tuple=False` in all places in ChromePDF. In ChromePDF 2.0, this function will return a string by default.
- `chromepdf.webdrivers` functionality that accepts Chrome versions as tuples has been deprecated. They can now accept either a tuple or string version, but tuples will raise a deprecation warning. In ChromePDF 2.0, these functions will only accept strings.

**Fixed**

- Fixed a unit test that was encountering issues due to use of NamedTemporaryFile, resulting in a PDF that was missing some contents.
- Fixed some error messages from the command-line API which were displaying an incorrect command name.

## [1.4.0](https://github.com/imsweb/django-chromepdf/tree/1.4.0) - 2022-09-19

**Added**

- Added a command-line API for generating PDFs without having to write Python code. See the new section in the readme for more information.


## [1.3.2](https://github.com/imsweb/django-chromepdf/tree/1.3.2) - 2022-06-06

**Fixed**

- Fixed an issue where multithreading and/or multi-user simultaneous PDF generation could cause stalling due to attempts to write to the same files. Chrome is now launched with the `--incognito` and `--disable-crash-reporter` args to disable creation of files that caused these conflicts.


## [1.3.1](https://github.com/imsweb/django-chromepdf/tree/1.3.1) - 2022-03-04

**Fixed**

- Fixed file permission issues in Chrome 99+ by storing user data and crash dumps into local folder instead of global folder.
- Fixed a `ResourceWarning` due to webdriver connections not properly being closed.
- Fixed a `DeprecationWarning` raised by Selenium 4 changing the way a chromedriver is passed, from `executable_path` to `Service` objects.


## [1.3.0](https://github.com/imsweb/django-chromepdf/tree/1.3.0) - 2021-12-06

**Changed**

- Selenium 4 is now preferred; Selenium 3 is still supported (dependency changed from `selenium<4` to `selenium<5,>=3`)
- Minimum-supported Django version is now 3.2 (Django is not a required dependency but can be used for global configs; using prior versions may work but is not guaranteed)

**Added**

- Added support for downloading Apple M1 ARM-compatible chromedrivers when used on an Apple M1 device.


## [1.2.1](https://github.com/imsweb/django-chromepdf/tree/1.2.1) - 2021-03-04

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where the chromedriver download path was not being used if a chromedriver was just downloaded. This bug was introduced in 1.2.0. Earlier versions are not affected.


## [1.2.0](https://github.com/imsweb/django-chromepdf/tree/1.2.0) - 2021-02-04

**Added**

- Added a `CHROME_ARGS` Django setting (and `chrome_args` function parameter to `generate_pdf()`) which accepts a list of string parameters to pass to Google Chrome when calling it.
- Added compatibility with MacOS.

**Changed**

- `pdf_kwargs` is no longer a required parameter for`ChromePdfMaker.generate_pdf()`, similar to the shortcut function, `generate_pdf()`


## [1.1.1](https://github.com/imsweb/django-chromepdf/tree/1.1.1) - 2020-11-03

**Fixed**

- Lengths passed as a `Decimal` type will now be converted to `float` rather than raising an exception due to not being JSON-serializable.

**Added**

- Added compatibility with Selenium 4. Selenium 4 now uses proxy environment variables unless it is explicitly told not to. ChromePDF now tells it not to. ChromePDF still requires Selenium 3 as a requirement. The actual switch to Selenium 4 will occur in a future release.
- Added URI schema check for `generate_pdf_url()`. This function will now raise a `ValueError` for invalid schemas rather than passing Chrome a URI that it cannot handle.
- Added additional unit tests, especially for unit conversions and stress testing of large PDFs.


## 1.1.0 - 2020-10-01

**Added**

- First Public Release
